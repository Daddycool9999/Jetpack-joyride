### Inheritance:
  hero and boss classes are inherited from person in character.py.
### Encapsulation :
  The fact that Iâ€™m using classes and objects suffice for this!
### Abstraction :
  This is used in hero,person,bullet etc many class.
### Polymorphism:
  gravity and scoreprint functions are only applied for hero class not for it's parent class-person, so they are changing for them.
### Controls:
w for up,d for right, a for left, b for shoot, space for shield.
